Therefore, the correct answer is NO, as the conclusion does not follow.<br\/>2. For all we know, all the researchers could have been female. We do not have enough information to deduce that any males were researchers, or if any were not. Therefore, the correct answer is NO, as the conclusion does not follow.<br\/>3. Some of the female attendees could have been scientists, we don\u2019t know \u2013 just because all the males were scientists does not mean all the scientists present were males. Therefore, the correct answer is NO, as the conclusion does not follow.<br\/>4. If not all the scientists present were researchers, then it stands that at least one of the scientists was not a researcher (which means that that researcher was not a scientist). Therefore, the correct answer is YES, as the conclusion does follow.<br\/>5. Since all the males were scientists, if one male was a researcher then it stands that at least one male was a scientist and a researcher (so there was a scientist who was a researcher too). Therefore, the correct answer is YES, as the conclusion does follow. "

However, we need to find the overlap between the two, which is represented by \u2018History + Geography\u2019 because if we add the 23 students who chose History to the 10 students who chose Geography, we will be repeating \u2018History + Geography\u2019 twice in our calculations. The overlap: If 23 students chose to do History, and 5 chose \u2018only History\u2019 and 15 chose \u2018History + Politics\u2019, that means 3 must have chosen \u2018History + Geography\u2019 (since no student can choose all 3 subjects). Thus the overlap = 3, so the total number of students that did not choose \u2018only Politics\u2019 = 23 + 10 \u2013 3 = 30. Thus, 50 \u2013 30 = 20 students must have chosen \u2018only Politics\u2019. Therefore, the correct answer is C."

All we know from the stem is that the intersection between A and B circles in the Venn diagram is 2, the intersection between all 3 circles (A, B, C) is 3 and the intersection between B and C circles is 11. If we trial the first answer option A, where class A has 20 students in total, that would mean the number of students in the A circle only would be 15 (because 20 - 2 - 3 = 15). Thus, the number of students in only B and only C would be 9\/2, which is impossible (because there are 40 students in total, 40 - 2 - 3 - 11 - 15 = 9, and the number of students in only B and only C is meant to be equal). Therefore A is correct."

Given that the USSR had civilian casualties of close to 17 million people, and all the 11 countries in the second graph had far less than 1 million civilian casualties (which means altogether much less than 11 million), we can observe that overall, the civilian casualties were more than the military casualties in WWII. All the other countries in the top graph also had more civilian than military casualties except Japan. This statement is also not a generalisation because it states that these were all the countries involved (so these were all the casualties). Therefore, the correct answer is YES, as the conclusion does follow.<br\/>2. We cannot determine the reason for the low civilian casualties in the USA based just off this information. Therefore, the correct answer is NO, as the conclusion does not follow.<br\/>3. France = close to 800,000, while Yugoslavia = around 1.8 million. Thus, we can say that France has less than half the casualties of Yugoslavia. Therefore, the correct answer is NO, as the conclusion does not follow.<br\/>4. Polish military casualties = just under 1 million. USA + Austria military casualties = under 300,000 + 375,000 = under 675,000, which is still less than 1 million for Poland.

Only 27.6% of students dropped out because they were failing too many classes, which is not a majority, however the statement also generalises beyond the data, since this is only a survey of 1000 students, not all students. Therefore, the correct answer is NO, as the conclusion does not follow.<br\/>3. Only 2.2% of students dropped out because of bullying, compared to 11.6% who said they got into drugs. Since the sample size of 1000 is the same for both categories, we can say more students in the survey dropped out because they got into drugs than because they were bullied. Therefore, the correct answer is YES, as the conclusion does follow.<br\/>4. There is no evidence in the graph to suggest that making classes more interesting will reduce drop outs (even though 25.9% said they were bored, this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that in general drop outs can be prevented by making classes more interesting).

Therefore, the correct answer is NO, as the conclusion does not follow.<br\/>2. From 1931-1970, the Netherlands supplied the US with the most immigrants. Therefore, the correct answer is NO, as the conclusion does not follow.<br\/>3. Of the four countries shown, this statement may be true, however we do not know if the US received immigrants from countries other than these 4 Northern European countries or not, so we cannot say for sure that the US received the most immigrants from Sweden during this time. Therefore, the correct answer is NO, as the conclusion does not follow.<br\/>4. Again, we do not know if the US received immigrants from countries other than the 4 Northern European countries in the graph or not, so we cannot say that this statement is true for sure. Therefore, the correct answer is NO, as the conclusion does not follow.<br\/>5. The approximate number of Northern European immigrants to the US from 1921-30 would be less than 300,000, since the combined number of immigrants from Denmark and the Netherlands is less than 100,000 (this is by observation, since neither is equal to or larger than 50,000). Thus, since the number of immigrants from Norway is less than 100,000 but greater than 50,000, and the number of immigrants from Sweden = 100,000, we know the total number of Northern European immigrants is somewhere between 250,000-300,000. Therefore, the correct answer is YES, as the conclusion does follow."

We can tell by observation (rather than calculating which might take a while), that the median time would be somewhere between 90 to 110mins, as the columns form a sort of symmetrical shape with the two middle columns being the highest. Thus, is it impossible for the median to be in the 80-90mins category. Therefore, the correct answer is NO, as the conclusion does not follow.<br\/>3. People requiring help for 50-60mins = 105. People requiring help for 130-140mins = 271. Thus, 271\/2 = 135.5, which is greater than 105 people. Therefore, the correct answer is YES, as the conclusion does follow.<br\/>4. Instead of adding all the columns together, we can estimate that less than 2000 people required help for 90-110mins, and around just more than 2000 people required help for 70-90mins and 110-130mins combined. The remaining columns add up to less than 1000 but more than 700 at least (by observation), so we know that more than 4,000 people required online help. Therefore, the correct answer is NO, as the conclusion does not follow.<br\/>5. We cannot calculate the average time that people required for online help, since each column is only a range of time.
