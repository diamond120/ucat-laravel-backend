          "text": "A team of researchers from the University of British Columbia (UBC) is studying kimberlite that is found in Nunavut, which is an igneous rock that forms hundreds of kilometres beneath the Earth\u2019s surface and occasionally contains diamonds. Maya Kopylova, a geologist and professor at UBC, says that many mining companies have a high level of interest in exploring Nunavut and other northern regions of Canada because of the valuable minerals that can be found underneath the Earth\u2019s surface. <br\/>The lost continent fragments were discovered when the researchers were analyzing diamond deposits and noticed other unique compositions, which surprisingly indicated that a landmass was previously there. The fragment that was discovered is from the North Atlantic Craton, which is an ancient part of the Earth\u2019s continental crust that ran from Scotland to North America. The craton broke up 150 million years ago and Kopylova says that the discovery adds roughly 10 per cent to the known expanse of the North Atlantic Craton. <br\/>Other regions that contain parts of the North Atlantic Craton include Scotland, Greenland and Labrador in Atlantic Canada. The details of this discovery have been outlined in a study that was published in the Journal of Petrology and the researchers say that their discovery will help us learn more about how continents have formed over millions of years. <br\/>A vast amount of Earth\u2019s geological history is unknown and scientists are continuously reporting fascinating discoveries. A study that was published in September 2019 revealed that a lost continent was found nearly 1,500 kilometres underneath Europe. Researchers found that a piece of continental crust the size of Greenland separated from North Africa 240 million years ago and plunged into the Earth's mantle underneath Southern Europe. The only part of the continent that remains today is a relatively small section that runs along northern Italy through the most eastern tip of the country and the top few kilometres of the lost continent can still be seen in the mountain ranges.<br\/>Source: https:\/\/www.theweathernetwork.com\/ca\/news\/article\/ancient-lost-continent-has-been-discovered-near-nunavut-canada?",

A new study may reveal how they do it. <br\/>Wen Ping, an ecologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences\u2019s Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, wondered whether a specific type of scent molecule might help undertaker bees find their fallen hive mates. Ants, bees, and other insects are covered in compounds called cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), which compose part of the waxy coating on their cuticles (the shiny parts of their exoskeletons) and help prevent them from drying out. While the insects are alive, these molecules are continually released into the air and are used to recognize fellow hive members. Wen speculated that less of the pheromones were being released into the air after a bee died and its body temperature decreased. When he used chemical methods of detecting gases to test this hypothesis, he confirmed that cooled dead bees were indeed emitting fewer volatile CHCs than living bees. <br\/>Wen then designed a series of experiments to see whether undertaker bees were picking up on this change. He turned to five hives belonging to Asian honeybees (Apis cerana Fabricius), a small, hardy insect found across Asia, and began to heat up the corpses of perished honeybees. When he placed regular, cool dead bees in a hive, workers always removed them within half an hour. However, when he placed the bee in a heated petri dish and warmed it up by a few degrees Celsius, it often took undertakers several hours to even notice the body. That\u2019s presumably because the warm bee body was releasing close to the same amount of CHCs as a living bee, he reports in a preprint published this month on bioRxiv. <br\/>To seal the deal, Wen washed the CHCs off dead bees with hexane, which can dissolve waxes and oils, heated them up to about the temperature of a live bee, and placed them back in their respective hives. The undertakers sprang into action and removed nearly 90% of the hot, clean dead bees within half an hour. That suggests it\u2019s not temperature, but the absence of CHC emissions that undertakers use to diagnose death. <br\/> Source: https:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/news\/2020\/03\/how-undertaker-bees-recognize-dead-comrades",

State-based policies also exclude children from childcare facilities if they have not been fully vaccinated according to the National Immunisation Program Schedule. Victoria has the strictest requirements, with full immunisation necessary for childcare attendance, unless the child has an approved medical exemption or is on a recognised catch-up schedule. In New South Wales, legislation has recently been tightened to also require children attending childcare centres to be fully immunised. <br\/>Despite varied support and rates of vaccination compliance across jurisdictions, the study showed there is strong support among voters of all political parties. \u2018This is important because it shows that in Australia, mandatory vaccination plays out as good politics for all parties,\u2019 study co-author Dr Katie Attwell from the UWA said. \u2018In contrast to similar studies in the US and UK, we found that support for both vaccination and mandate is very high, with no significant opposition from any political sub-group.\u2019 <br\/>Australia has some of the strictest vaccination policies in the world, and the No Jab, No Pay scheme has seen a significant increase in national vaccine compliance. In 2016\u201317, 93.5% of all children aged five were fully immunised and all Primary Health Network areas achieved an immunisation rate of 90% or more. Elimination of certain preventable diseases in Australia, such as rubella, is considered testimony to the efficacy of vaccination and high compliance rates. However, vaccine hesitancy remains an issue in parts of Australia, as well as the rest of the world.<br\/>Source: https:\/\/www1.racgp.org.au\/newsgp\/clinical\/mandatory-vaccination-backed-by-majority-of-austra",

Various moulds and plant extracts were used to treat infections by some of the earliest civilisations \u2013 the ancient Egyptians, for example, applied mouldy bread to infected wounds. Nevertheless, until the 20th century, infections that we now consider straightforward to treat \u2013 such as pneumonia and diarrhoea \u2013 that are caused by bacteria, were the number one cause of human death in the developed world. <br\/>It wasn\u2019t until the late 19th century that scientists began to observe antibacterial chemicals in action. Paul Ehrlich, a German physician, noted that certain chemical dyes coloured some bacterial cells but not others. He concluded that, according to this principle, it must be possible to create substances that can kill certain bacteria selectively without harming other cells. In 1909, he discovered that a chemical called arsphenamine was an effective treatment for syphilis. This became the first modern antibiotic, although Ehrlich himself referred to his discovery as 'chemotherapy' \u2013 the use of a chemical to treat a disease. The word 'antibiotics' was first used over 30 years later by the Ukrainian-American inventor and microbiologist Selman Waksman, who in his lifetime discovered over 20 antibiotics. <br\/>Alexander Fleming was, it seems, a bit disorderly in his work and accidentally discovered penicillin. Upon returning from a holiday in Suffolk in 1928, he noticed that a fungus, Penicillium notatum, had contaminated a culture plate of Staphylococcus bacteria he had accidentally left uncovered. The fungus had created bacteria-free zones wherever it grew on the plate. Fleming isolated and grew the mould in pure culture. He found that P. notatum proved extremely effective even at very low concentrations, preventing Staphylococcus growth even when diluted 800 times, and was less toxic than the disinfectants used at the time.<br\/>Source: https:\/\/microbiologysociety.org\/members-outreach-resources\/outreach-resources\/antibiotics-unearthed\/antibiotics-and-antibiotic-resistance\/the-history-of-antibiotics.html",

India is also planning to take the same initiative. A Delhi-based company \u2018Kurin Systems\u2019 has recently got the patent of the world's largest air purifier. It is a structure of concrete that has multiple layers of filters. The size of this structure would be 40 feet in height and 20 feet on each side. In total it requires a compound of around 30x30 metres. The device will be able to take in air from all 360-degree angles and generate 1,300,000 cubic metres of clean air per hour. <br\/>Although its capacity would have the capacity to clean 32 million cubic metres of air per day. This giant purifier will have 48 fans to keep the flow of clean air going. The manufacturer of this device claims that it could provide clean air to 75,000 people living in the 3 kilometre radius around it. The smog tower sucks the polluted air, which is purified by the multiple layers before re-circulated into the atmosphere. To purify the air; the highly effective H14 grade Highly Effective Particulate Arrestance (HEPA) filter would be used. This filter can clean up to 99.99% Particulate Matter (PM) present in the air with the help of pre-filter and activated carbon. The cost of each smog tower is to be around Rs. 10 to 12 crores which includes filtering equipment, monitoring system and construction of the tower.<br\/>Source: https:\/\/www.jagranjosh.com\/general-knowledge\/what-is-smog-tower-1575288333-1",

At that time, Syracuse was one of the most influential cities of the ancient world, according to Scientific American. Trading vessels from Egypt, Greece and Phoenicia filled the city-state's harbor. It was also a hub of commerce, art and science, according to the Archimedes Palimpsest. After studying geometry and astronomy in Alexandria, the 'greatest intellectual centre in the ancient world,' according to Scientific American, Archimedes settled down in Syracuse to pursue a life of thought and invention. <br\/>One of his inventions was the Archimedes screw. This device uses a corkscrew with a hollow tube. When the screw turns, water is pulled up the tube. It was originally used to empty sea water from a ship's hull. It is still used today as a method of irrigation in developing countries, according to the Archimedes Palimpsest. <br\/>Archimedes famously said, 'Give me a lever and a place to stand, and I'll move the world.'' This boastful claim expresses the power of leverage, which, at least figuratively, moves the world. Archimedes realized that in order to accomplish the same amount or work, one could make a trade-off between force and distance using a lever. His Law of the Lever states, 'Magnitudes are in equilibrium at distances reciprocally proportional to their weights,' according to 'Archimedes in the 21st Century,' a virtual book by Chris Rorres at New York University. <br\/>Archimedes also devised defenses for Syracuse against invading armies. He strengthened the walls of Syracuse and constructed war machines. His works held off the Romans for two years. However, in 212 B.C., forces under General Marcellus overtook the city.<br\/>Source: https:\/\/www.livescience.com\/58839-archimedes-principle.html",

          "text": "Motion sickness, also known as travel sickness, is a condition caused by the difference which exists between a person\u2019s visually perceived movement and the vestibular system. The vestibular system is the part of your body which is responsible for spatial orientation, movement and balance. The most common signs and symptoms of motion sickness are dizziness, fatigue, and nausea. It\u2019s no surprise that \u2018nausea\u2019 in Greek means seasickness (naus means ship). Roughly 33% of the population is susceptible to motion sickness even in mild cases such as being on a boat in calm water, and 66% of us are susceptible in severe conditions. <br\/>A part of the brain \u2013 called the \u2018area postrema\u2019 \u2013 is responsible for both inducing vomiting when poisons are detected, and for resolving conflicts between vision and balance. When you feel motion but don\u2019t see it, your inner ear tells this part of the brain that it senses motion, but the eyes tell it that everything is standing still. As a result of the discrepancy, your brain will think that one of them is hallucinating and that the hallucination is due to poison or neurotoxin ingestion. The brain responds by inducing vomiting to clear the supposed toxin or poison. In short, motion sickness is caused by your body believing it is being attacked by a neurotoxin or poison. <br\/>Several forms of treatments exist for motion sickness. One common method is to simply look out of the window of the moving vehicle and to stare toward the horizon in the direction of travel. This will help to re-orient your inner sense of balance by providing visual reaffirmation of motion. At night, or in a vehicle without windows, it is suggested to close your eyes or take a nap. This will resolve the input conflict between your eyes and the inner ear. Napping can also help prevent psychogenic effects (sickness being magnified by thinking about it). <br\/>There is OTC and prescription medications also available for mild to moderate cases of motion sickness. These include Dramamine, Stugeron, and Antivert. Scopolamine is also effective for motion sickness and is used in the form of a transdermal patch.<br\/>Source: https:\/\/zidbits.com\/2011\/08\/what-causes-motion-sickness\/",

Muscae volitantes are described or defined as particles, soot, spiders, cobwebs, worms, dark streaks, or rings which float in your field of vision. Nearly everybody experiences them, though in individuals who are nearsighted, they\u2019re much more common. Generally \u2013 not always \u2013 they\u2019re fairly harmless. <br\/>Floaters are believed to be the remnants of the hyaloid artery. It\u2019s an artery which nourished parts of your eye during fetal development. As you matured in the womb, the artery eventually withered away. While it was active and doing its job, the artery floated around in your vitreous humor, which is the fluid that fills your eyeball behind the lens. It ran from the lens in your eye to the other end where the optic nerve comes in. After the third month of fetal development, it began to atrophy. Around the 7th month, the blood stopped flowing through the artery and it slowly disintegrated. Most of the little bits of debris were evacuated by the time you were born, but tiny amounts of it still remain in your vitreous humor and will stay with you for the rest of your life. <br\/>Retinal tears in the eye may also cause floaters if red blood cells are released into the eye from leaky blood vessels. Other (more rare) causes for floaters include cystoid macular edema and asteroid hyalosis. Asteroid hyalosis is an anomaly of the vitreous humour, and is caused by calcium clumps attaching themselves to the collagen network. These clumps are different in that they only move slightly with eye movement then return to their fixed position.<br\/>Source: https:\/\/zidbits.com\/2011\/06\/what-are-eye-floaters\/",

Diseases like the plague, chicken pox, influenza, measles, scarlet fever, smallpox, tuberculosis, and whooping cough. The Europeans who first colonized the Americas were a veritable Pandora\u2019s box of disease and death. It is estimated that a staggering 80-90% of the entire Native American population was lost to diseases brought by the new American settlers. But what about the Native American diseases? Weren\u2019t the Europeans susceptible to them? Why didn\u2019t the reverse happen? <br\/>The leading theory is based on the European\u2019s mobility and heavy intermixing. For thousands of years, Europe had been a crossroads for trade and war. Trading could be had from the British Isles all the way to the shores of Japan, Asia. Because of this constant contact with outsiders, strangers and visitors from faraway places, they had already encountered an extraordinary number of diseases and plagues. This made the average European\u2019s immune system incredibly robust. On the other hand, the Americas were quite isolated by comparison, virtually cut off from the rest of the world. While different groups of Native Americans did occasionally intermix and\/or go to war with one another, it wasn\u2019t remotely close to the breadth and scale of their counterparts across the Atlantic. <br\/>Relative to the Europeans, the Native American\u2019s immune system was virtually non-existent by comparison. Further compounding the problem was the fact that the Native Americans of early America were descendants from a very small, homogenous group \u2013 their gene pool was limited. Immune systems thrive on variety. The greater the variety of things an immune system experiences, the greater number of microbes it can immediately recognize and therefore destroy before causing harm.<br\/>Source: https:\/\/zidbits.com\/2011\/01\/why-didnt-europeans-get-wiped-out-by-native-americans-diseases\/",

The Money Pit goes down at least 90 feet and no one has yet reached the bottom, however many believe riches are lying in wait. Every attempt to explore the sinkhole has been wrought with flooding and cave-ins, resulting in at least 6 deaths. Excavations have revealed evidence of man-made architectural structures and strange man-made artefacts have been recovered from the pit over the years. But to this day, the treasure, if it exists, still remains buried. <br\/>Where did this story of lost treasure originate? There are a few theories. The first states that the pit holds a pirate treasure hoard buried by Captain Kidd or Edward Teach (Blackbeard), who claimed he buried his treasure \u201cwhere none but Satan and myself can find it.\u201d Some also believe that Kidd conspired with Henry Every and Oak Island was used as a pseudo community bank between the two. <br\/>The second states it was done by someone other than pirates, such as Spanish sailors from a wrecked galleon or British troops during the American Revolution. John Godwin believed that, given the apparent size and complexity of the pit, it was likely dug by French army engineers hoping to hide the contents of the treasury of the Fortress of Louisbourg after it fell to the British during the Seven Years\u2019 War.<br\/>Source: https:\/\/zidbits.com\/2010\/12\/a-real-treasure-island\/",

It\u2019s usually sold under the brand names \u2018Nutrasweet\u2019 and \u2018Equal\u2019. <br\/>Over the last 30 years, it has become a permanent ingredient in diet sodas, sugar-free chewing gum, and other sugar free products. Aspartame was discovered in 1965 by James M. Schlatter, a chemist working for G.D. Searle & Co, while he was working on an antiulcer drug. Licking his finger (which had become contaminated with aspartame) to turn a page in a book, Schlatter had accidentally discovered its sweet taste. <br\/>In 1970, there were only two artificial sweeteners on the market. They were both eventually banned after being linked to health problems. This happened just as GD Searle company was trying to release its new artificial sweetener, but it wasn\u2019t without controversy itself. Reportedly, the first tests on animals went horribly. Opponents of aspartame claimed that monkeys had died, baby mice got holes in their brains, and deformities occurred. The company pumped millions of dollars into these studies and improving its new product until they felt they had enough safety evidence. Critics also accused GD Searle of manipulating the data which led to the FDA asking the US Attorney to start a criminal investigation against the company in 1976. In December 1977, the case was dropped for lack of evidence. As the years passed, aspartame was approved for more and more products. <br\/>While aspartame can adversely effect some people \u2014 people who are unable to metabolize the amino acid \u2018phenylalanine\u2019 \u2014 it has been rigorously tested more than 200 times. Each of which have found it to be safe for consumption. While there has been a couple recent studies that suggest a possible link between artificial sweeteners and obesity, a direct link between additives and weight gain has yet to be found.<br\/>Source: https:\/\/zidbits.com\/2011\/04\/is-aspartame-bad-for-you\/",
